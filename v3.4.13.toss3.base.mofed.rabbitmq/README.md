# Build notes:

The rpms here support a very specific MOFED Infiniband stack. Change the 
BuildRequires lines in ovis.spec.in if you have a different Infiniband stack.

Daemons install to /usr
Runtime files appear in /var/run

To Build it all:

Install the dependencies listed at the end, then:

./fireovis
./root-makerepo

# Installation:

You now have an RPM repository set up containing all the rpms 
generated by fireovis, so you should be able to install like so:

```
rpm -Uvh ovis-local.repo/*.x86_64.rpm
```

# Running hints (configuration of ldmsd and use of systemd is covered elsewhere)
Then to get the daemon running, you will need to (per your site tastes) fix the authentication 
to be a real authentication secret file or a symbolic link, perhaps with a link:
```
cd /etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ClusterSecrets
```
and note that ldmsauth.conf must start with a valid secretword= line and have permissions 600.
