# Building

These are example spec files pulled from the ATSE opensuse build service robot.
They create OVIS packages for Thunder X2 ARM and x86_64 running the ATSE TOSS3 derivative.
The packages target the standard FHS locations (/usr, /etc).

Adapting them to another OBS instance is an exercise left to the reader.
