### Build notes:

The rpms here are NOT relocatable in any way.
They omit the SOS store and its python dependencies and the papi-related samplers.

Daemons install to /usr
Runtime files appear in /var/run

To Build it all:

Install the dependencies listed at the end, then:

./fireovis

./fireldms

./rootmakerepo

### Installation:

You now have an RPM repository set up containing all the rpms 
generated by fire\* scripts, so you should be able
to install convenience package ovis:

```
yum install ovis
```

To get started without reconfiguring yum, just use (assuming an x86_64 host):

```
rpm -Uvh ovis-local.repo/*.x86_64.rpm
```

### Running hints (configuration of ldmsd and use of systemd is covered elsewhere)
Then to get the daemon running, you will need to (per your site tastes) fix the authentication 
to be a real authentication secret file or a symbolic link, perhaps with a link:
```
cd /etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ClusterSecrets
```
and note that ldmsauth.conf must start with a valid secretword= line and have permissions 600.
