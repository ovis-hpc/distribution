### Build notes:

The rpms here are NOT relocatable in any way.
They omit the SOS store and ldms sos plugin.

Daemons install to /usr
Runtime files appear in /var/run

To Build it all:

Install the dependencies listed at the end, then:

    ./fireovis

    ./fireldms

    ./rootmakerepo

### Installation:

You now have an RPM repository set up containing all the rpms 
generated by fire\* scripts. You can add this repository to your /etc/yum.repos.d if desired, so you can then install convenience package ovis:

```
yum install ovis
```

To get started without reconfiguring yum, however, just use (assuming an x86_64 host):

```
rpm -Uvh ovis-local.repo/*.x86_64.rpm
```

### Running hints (configuration of ldmsd and use of systemd is covered elsewhere)
Then to get the daemon running, you will need to (per your site tastes) fix the authentication 
to be a real authentication secret file or a symbolic link, perhaps with a link:
```
cd /etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ClusterSecrets
```
and note that ldmsauth.conf must start with a valid secretword= line and have permissions 600.

Alternatively, you can use munge authentication instead of the shared secret file.

### Package Dependencies:

### Proxy dependency
If your site requires use of HTTP proxies, create a file ../support/proxy_settings which exports the appropriate proxy settings, e.g.:

```
https_proxy=nouser:nopass@proxyhost.gov:80
http_proxy=nouser:nopass@proxyhost.gov:80 
```
