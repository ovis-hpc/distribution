# Build notes:

The rpms here are NOT relocatable in any way.
They omit the SOS store and its python dependencies and the papi-related samplers.

Daemons install to /usr
Runtime files appear in /var/run

To Build it all:

Install the dependencies listed at the end, then:

./fireovis

./fireldms
and then install at least

# Installation:

If you have an RPM repository set up containing all the rpms 
generated by fire\*, you should then be able
to install convenience package ovis:
```
yum install ovis
```

You can create an RPM repo from the files created by fire\*
running the 'root-makerepo' script.
It's use is an exercise left to the reader. You probably want
to specify a directory other than the build tree for the repo.

Then to get the daemon running, you will need to (per your site tastes) fix the authentication 
to be a real authentication secret file or a symbolic link, perhaps with a link:
```
cd /etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ClusterSecrets
```
and note that ldmsauth.conf must contain a valid secretword line and have permissions 600.
